# Diggus Maximus Reborn

A fork of Diggus Maximus with Minecraft 1.20.2+ support.  

This mod was developed to simplify the process of mining veins consisting of identical blocks. By holding down the "excavate" key (which is bound to ~ by default but can be configured), while mining a block, all connected blocks will also be mined simultaneously, saving the player time compared to mining each block individually.  
It must be installed on both the client and the server. When playing on a server, the server's configuration will take precedence over the client's.  

See [the original mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diggus-maximus). (Below 1.20.1.)
